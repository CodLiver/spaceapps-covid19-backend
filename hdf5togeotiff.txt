Location of the input folder containing HDF images

os.chdir('C:\\InputFolder')

Current script only reads the first file (if there are multiple files in the input folder).The rasterFiles[ ] index can be modified to select one specific file, or iterate through all files within the input folder

hdflayer = gdal.Open(rasterFiles[0], gdal.GA_ReadOnly)

Reading specfic raster layer - GetSubDatasets()[0][0] for first layer, GetSubDatasets()[1][0] for second layer, and so on

hdflayer.GetSubDatasets()[0][0]

Location of the folder for output images

outputFolder = "C:\\OutputFolder\\"

Display output GeoTiff image in QGIS (Only if the script is executed within QGIS python Console)

iface.addRasterLayer(outputRaster, outputNameFinal)
